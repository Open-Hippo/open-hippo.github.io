Following the principle of data minimization, we aim to reduce the collected data to a minimum. However, personal data is collected when you use the website and our services and when you contact Open Hippo.

### 3.1 What personal data is collected when visiting the website?
When you visit our website and our services, your IP address, browser information, timestamp, and comparable information are saved as part of the server logs.

In addition to the data collected as described in section 3.1, when you use our Hippo API service, called Hippo Token, we collect and store usage data including consumed tokens and credits, subscription data, as well as your contact information. Payment data is stored by our third-party payment processor (as described in section 4.3). We process this data on the basis of our legitimate interest to provide our services, ensure accurate billing, and monitor service usage. This data is retained only as long as necessary for these purposes and in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

### 3.3 Do you track my usage of the website and services?
We use self-hosted analytics tools to track your usage of our website and services.

The data is stored securely on our servers and is retained only as long as necessary for analysis purposes, typically no longer than 12 months.

When you contact us in writing by mail or email we process your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest to respond to your inquiries. The data you provide when contacting us remains with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent for storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies, for example after your request has been processed.
